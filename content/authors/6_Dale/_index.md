Epigenome editing tools for DNA methylation engineering for crop improvement

A first year PhD student interested in methods of DNA and genome editing as applied in plants and looking to develop those methods towards future discoveries. Currently working on dCas9-directed DNA methylation and demethylation in plant models.
