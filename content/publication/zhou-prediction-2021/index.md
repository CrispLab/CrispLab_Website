abstract: Changes in gene expression are important for responses to abiotic stress.
  Transcriptome profiling of heat- or cold-stressed maize genotypes identifies many
  changes in transcript abundance. We used comparisons of expression responses in
  multiple genotypes to identify alleles with variable responses to heat or cold stress
  and to distinguish examples of cis- or trans-regulatory variation for stress-responsive
  expression changes. We used motifs enriched near the transcription start sites (TSSs)
  for thermal stress-responsive genes to develop predictive models of gene expression
  responses. Prediction accuracies can be improved by focusing only on motifs within
  unmethylated regions near the TSS and vary for genes with different dynamic responses
  to stress. Models trained on expression responses in a single genotype and promoter
  sequences provided lower performance when applied to other genotypes but this could
  be improved by using models trained on data from all three genotypes tested. The
  analysis of genes with cis-regulatory variation provides evidence for structural
  variants that result in presence/absence of transcription factor binding sites in
  creating variable responses. This study provides insights into cis-regulatory motifs
  for heat- and cold-responsive gene expression and defines a framework for developing
  models to predict expression responses across multiple genotypes.
