abstract: Photo-inhibitory high light stress in Arabidopsis leads to increases in
  markers of protein degradation and transcriptional upregulation of proteases and
  proteolytic machinery, but proteostasis is largely maintained. We find significant
  increases in the in vivo degradation rate for specific molecular chaperones, nitrate
  reductase, glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase, and phosphoglycerate kinase
  and other plastid, mitochondrial, peroxisomal, and cytosolic enzymes involved in
  redox shuttles. Coupled analysis of protein degradation rates, mRNA levels, and
  protein abundance reveal that 57% of the nuclear-encoded enzymes with higher degradation
  rates also had high light-induced transcriptional responses to maintain proteostasis.
  In contrast, plastid-encoded proteins with enhanced degradation rates showed decreased
  transcript abundances and must maintain protein abundance by other processes. This
  analysis reveals a light-induced transcriptional program for nuclear-encoded genes,
  beyond the regulation of PSII D1 subunit and the function of PSII, to replace key
  protein degradation targets in plants and ensure proteostasis under high light stress.
