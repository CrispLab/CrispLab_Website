abstract: Changes in gene expression are important for response to abiotic stress.
  Transcriptome profiling performed on maize inbred and hybrid genotypes subjected
  to heat or cold stress identifies many transcript abundance changes in response
  to these environmental conditions. Motifs that are enriched near differentially
  expressed genes were used to develop machine learning models to predict gene expression
  responses to heat or cold. The best performing models utilize the sequences both
  upstream and downstream of the transcription start site. Prediction accuracies could
  be improved using models developed for specific co-expression clusters compared
  to using all up- or down-regulated genes or by only using motifs within unmethylated
  regions. Comparisons of expression responses in multiple genotypes were used to
  identify genes with variable response and to identify cis- or trans-regulatory variation.
  Models trained on B73 data have lower performance when applied to Mo17 or W22, this
  could be improved by using models trained on data from all genotypes. However, the
  models have low accuracy for correctly predicting genes with variable responses
  to abiotic stress. This study provides insights into cis-regulatory motifs for heat-
  and cold-responsive gene expression and provides a framework for developing models
  to predict expression response to abiotic stress across multiple genotypes. One
  sentence summary Transcriptome profiling of maize inbred and hybrid seedlings subjected
  to heat or cold stress was used to identify key cis-regulatory elements and develop
  models to predict gene expression responses.
