abstract: CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing has been widely adopted for basic and
  applied biological research in eukaryotic systems. While many studies considered
  DNA sequences of CRISPR target sites as the primary determinant for CRISPR mutagenesis
  efficiency and mutation profiles, increasing evidence revealed the significant role
  of chromatin context. Nonetheless, most of the prior studies were limited by the
  lack of sufficient epigenetic resources and/or by only transiently expressing CRISPR-Cas9
  in a short time window. In this study, we leveraged the wealth of high-resolution
  epigenomic resources in Arabidopsis thaliana to address the impact of chromatin
  features on CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis using stable transgenic plants. Our results
  indicated that DNA methylation and chromatin features could lead to significant
  variations in mutagenesis efficiency by up to 250 folds. Low mutagenesis efficiencies
  were mostly associated with repressive heterochromatic features. This repressive
  effect appeared to persist through cell divisions but could be alleviated through
  substantial reduction of DNA methylation at CRISPR target sites. Moreover, specific
  chromatin features, such as H3K4me1, H3.3, and H3.1, appear to be associated with
  significant variations in CRISPR-Cas9 mutation profiles reflected by the 1 bp insertion
  rates. Our findings provided strong evidence that specific chromatin features could
  have significant and lasting impacts on both CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis efficiency
  and DNA double strand break repair outcomes.
