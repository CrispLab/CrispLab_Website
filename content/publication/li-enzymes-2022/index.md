abstract: Significance  Photoinhibitory high light stress in plants leads to increases
  in markers of protein degradation and transcriptional up-regulation of proteases
  and proteolytic machinery, but protein homeostasis (proteostasis) of most enzymes
  is largely maintained under high light, so we know little about the metabolic consequences
  of it beyond photosystem damage. We developed a technique to look for rapid protein
  turnover events in response to high light through 13 C partial labeling and detailed
  peptide mass spectrometry. This analysis reveals a light-induced transcriptional
  program for nuclear-encoded genes, beyond the regulation of photosystem II, to replace
  key protein degradation targets in plants and ensure proteostasis under high light
  stress.  ,   Photoinhibitory high light stress in Arabidopsis leads to increases
  in markers of protein degradation and transcriptional up-regulation of proteases
  and proteolytic machinery, but proteostasis is largely maintained. We find significant
  increases in the in vivo degradation rate for specific molecular chaperones, nitrate
  reductase, glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase, and phosphoglycerate kinase
  and other plastid, mitochondrial, peroxisomal, and cytosolic enzymes involved in
  redox shuttles. Coupled analysis of protein degradation rates, mRNA levels, and
  protein abundance reveal that 57% of the nuclear-encoded enzymes with higher degradation
  rates also had high light–induced transcriptional responses to maintain proteostasis.
  In contrast, plastid-encoded proteins with enhanced degradation rates showed decreased
  transcript abundances and must maintain protein abundance by other processes. This
  analysis reveals a light-induced transcriptional program for nuclear-encoded genes,
  beyond the regulation of the photosystem II (PSII) D1 subunit and the function of
  PSII, to replace key protein degradation targets in plants and ensure proteostasis
  under high light stress.
