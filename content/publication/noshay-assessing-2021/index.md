abstract: Transposable elements (TEs) have the potential to create regulatory variation
  both through the disruption of existing DNA regulatory elements and through the
  creation of novel DNA regulatory elements. In a species with a large genome, such
  as maize, many TEs interspersed with genes create opportunities for significant
  allelic variation due to TE presence/absence polymorphisms among individuals. We
  used information on putative regulatory elements in combination with knowledge about
  TE polymorphisms in maize to identify TE insertions that interrupt existing accessible
  chromatin regions (ACRs) in B73 as well as examples of polymorphic TEs that contain
  ACRs among four inbred lines of maize including B73, Mo17, W22, and PH207. The TE
  insertions in three other assembled maize genomes (Mo17, W22, or PH207) that interrupt
  ACRs that are present in the B73 genome can trigger changes to the chromatin, suggesting
  the potential for both genetic and epigenetic influences of these insertions. Nearly
  20% of the ACRs located over 2 kb from the nearest gene are located within an annotated
  TE. These are regions of unmethylated DNA that show evidence for functional importance
  similar to ACRs that are not present within TEs. Using a large panel of maize genotypes,
  we tested if there is an association between the presence of TE insertions that
  interrupt, or carry, an ACR and the expression of nearby genes. While most TE polymorphisms
  are not associated with expression for nearby genes, the TEs that carry ACRs exhibit
  enrichment for being associated with higher expression of nearby genes, suggesting
  that these TEs may contribute novel regulatory elements. These analyses highlight
  the potential for a subset of TEs to rewire transcriptional responses in eukaryotic
  genomes.
