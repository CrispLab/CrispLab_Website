abstract: For millennia, natural and artificial selection has combined favourable
  alleles for desirable traits in crop species. While modern plant breeding has achieved
  steady increases in crop yields over the last century, on the current trajectory
  we will simply not meet demand by 2045. Novel breeding strategies and sources of
  genetic variation will be required to sustainably fill predicted yield gaps and
  meet new consumer preferences. Here, we highlight that stepping up to meet this
  grand challenge will increasingly require thinking ‘beyond the gene’. Significant
  progress has been made in understanding the contributions of both epigenetic variation
  and cis-regulatory variation to plant traits. This non-genic variation has great
  potential in future breeding, synthetic biology and biotechnology applications.
