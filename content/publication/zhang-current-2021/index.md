abstract: 'Plant genome editing, particularly CRISPR-Cas biotechnologies, has rapidly
  evolved and drawn enormous attention all around the world in the last decade. The
  cutting-edge technologies have had substantial impact on precise genome editing
  for manipulating gene expression, stacking gene mutations, and improving crop agronomic
  traits. Following the global trends, investigations on CRISPR-Cas have been thriving
  in Australia, especially in agriculture sciences. Importantly, CRISPR-edited plants,
  classified as SDN-1 organisms (SDN: site-directed nuclease), have been given a green
  light in Australia, with regulatory bodies indicating they will not be classified
  as a genetically modified organism (GMO) if no foreign DNA is present in an edited
  plant. As a result, genome-edited products would not attract the onerous regulation
  required for the introduction of a GMO, which could mean more rapid deployment of
  new varieties and products that could be traded freely in Australia, and potentially
  to export markets. In the present review, we discuss the current status and prospects
  of plant genome editing in Australia by highlighting several species of interest.
  Using these species as case studies, we discuss the priorities and potential of
  plant genome editing, as well as the remaining challenges.'
