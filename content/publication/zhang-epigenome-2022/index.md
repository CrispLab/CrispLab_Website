abstract: Epigenomics encompasses a broad field of study, including the investigation
  of chromatin states, chromatin modifications and their impact on gene regulation;
  as well as the phenomena of epigenetic inheritance. The epigenome is a multi-modal
  layer of information superimposed on DNA sequences, instructing their usage in gene
  expression. As such, it is an emerging focus of efforts to improve crop performance.
  Broadly, this might be divided into avenues that leverage chromatin information
  to better annotate and decode plant genomes, and into complementary strategies that
  aim to identify and select for heritable epialleles that control crop traits independent
  of underlying genotype. In this review, we focus on the first approach, which we
  term ‘epigenome guided’ improvement. This encompasses the use of chromatin profiles
  to enhance our understanding of the composition and structure of complex crop genomes.
  We discuss the current progress and future prospects towards integrating this epigenomic
  information into crop improvement strategies; in particular for CRISPR/Cas9 gene
  editing and precision genome engineering. We also highlight some specific opportunities
  and challenges for grain and horticultural crops.
