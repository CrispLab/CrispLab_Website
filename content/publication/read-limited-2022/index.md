abstract: The Domains Rearranged Methyltransferases (DRMs) are crucial for RNA-directed
  DNA methylation (RdDM) in plant species. Setaria viridis is a model monocot species
  with a relatively compact genome that has limited transposable element content.
  CRISPR-based genome editing approaches were used to create loss-of-function alleles
  for the two putative functional DRM genes in S. viridis to probe the role of RdDM.
  The analysis of drm1ab double mutant plants revealed limited morphological consequences
  for the loss of RdDM. Whole-genome methylation profiling provided evidence for wide-spread
  loss of methylation in CHH sequence contexts, particularly in regions with high
  CHH methylation in wild-type plants. Evidence was also found for locus-specific
  loss of CG and CHG methylation, even in some regions that lack CHH methylation.
  Transcriptome profiling identified a limited number of genes with altered expression
  in the drm1ab mutants. The majority of genes with elevated CHH methylation directly
  surrounding the transcription start site or in nearby promoter regions do not have
  altered expression in the drm1ab mutant even when this methylation is lost, suggesting
  limited regulation of gene expression by RdDM. Detailed analysis of the expression
  of transposable elements identified several transposons that are transcriptionally
  activated in drm1ab mutants. These transposons likely require active RdDM for maintenance
  of transcriptional repression. Significance statement Methylation profiling of Setaria
  viridis plants that lack functional Domains Rearranged Methyltransferase genes reveal
  widespread loss of DNA methylation in the CHH sequence context. Transcriptome analysis
  reveals a small set of genes and transposons that are silenced by RNA-directed DNA
  methylation.
