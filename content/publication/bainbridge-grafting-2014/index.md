abstract: "Grafting provides a simple way to generate chimeric plants with regions of different genotypes and thus to assess the cell autonomy of gene action. The technique of grafting has been widely used in other species, but in Arabidopsis, its small size makes the process rather more demanding. However, there are now several well-established grafting procedures available, which we described here, and their use has already contributed greatly to understanding of such processes as shoot branching control, flowering, disease resistance, and systemic silencing."
